## Microsoft Dynamics 365 Announces Industry Accelerators

Dynamics 365 announced the Microsoft Power Platform, a connected app platform that unifies access to your data to enable ISVs, SIs, Partners and Customers to build intelligent, data driven, task focused business and analytic applications. Microsoft is focused on enabling a data culture where the Microsoft Power Platform acts as the glue across Dynamics 365 (CE, F&O, Talent), Office 365 (SharePoint, Teams), Power BI, Power Apps, Microsoft Flow, Azure and other 3rd party on-premise and cloud based solutions.

With the Power Platform providing a unified approach to building data driven solutions, the team is taking it one step further by introducing Industry Solution Accelerators. Accelerators are industry focused foundational components that enable ISVs and other solution providers, a way to build solutions that are based on industry standards supported and driven by Microsoft. Along with our Health Accelerator that was released during Inspire 2018, which you can read about here, we are focused on delivering accelerators for the following industries (but not limited too):

## Overview of the Industry Nonprofit Accelerator

The Dynamics 365 Nonprofit Accelerator enables ISVs, SIs and other partners to develop purpose built solutions for nonprofit scenarios on top of our Business Applications and Intelligence Platforms. The Nonprofit Accelerator is built on a nonprofit data schema on top of the Common Data Model (CDM), designed as a streamlined open foundation for vendors, partners and nonprofits to rapidly build applications and connectors. The CDM reflects industry best-practices and insight across program delivery, grant and award management, constituent management, fundraising, and donation management to enable powerful interoperability to fuel greater insight and efficacy, while also providing true data transparency.
